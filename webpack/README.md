# Webpack Example

This project shows you how to get started with Dropzone and webpack.

## Run it locally

Inside this project run:

```bash
$ yarn install
# or if you prefer npm:
$ npm install
```

whichever you prefer.

### Build it

Since this depends on webpack, the `dist/main.js` needs to be built:

```bash
$ yarn webpack
# or with npx:
$ npx webpack
```

Then open the `index.html` in your browser.
